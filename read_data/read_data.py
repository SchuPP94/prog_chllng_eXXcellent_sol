'''
This file contains the class which handles the class reading for the programming challenge.

The class will have a handler function, which automatically chooses which reader to take.

New file types can then be added by expanding the class with new reading methods and adding them 
to the handler function. Alternatively the correct reading function can be chosen directly.
